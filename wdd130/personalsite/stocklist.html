                <p>
                    VOO is a world-renowned ETF, 
                    issued by Vanguard (American 
                    Pioneer Group), which was 
                    established in 2010. Track the 
                    S&P500 index, which are the most 
                    famous and profitable large 
                    companies (large blue-chip stocks)
                    in the U.S. market. The total 
                    number of constituent stocks is 
                    about 500, including well-known 
                    companies such as GOOGLE, Apple, 
                    Amazon, FB, Microsoft, Poksha and 
                    Jiaosheng. These stocks are considered
                    to be quite safe, because these large 
                    companies are unlikely to go bankrupt. 
                    However, because the scale of these 
                    stocks is quite large, profits are 
                    unlikely to increase significantly, 
                    which is more suitable for investors 
                    who want stability to choose.
